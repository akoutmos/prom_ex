## [Unreleased]

## [1.7.0] - 2021-03-01

### Added

- Added ability to execute arbitrary function on resulting dashboard for user customization.
- The GrafanaClient is now considered part of the public API, and users can interact with Grafana directly. For example,
  users can publish their own Grafana annotations in addition to the annotations provided by PromEx.
- Added the ability to start GrafanaAgent via a port so that metrics can be published via `remote_write` to an other
  Prometheus instance. For example, if you are using GrafanaCloud, you can use PromEx to push metrics right to
  GrafanaCloud using the appropriate configuration. This feature is currently only available for Linux and OS X.
- The `ETSCronFlusher` GenServer can now be configured to flush the ETS buffer at whatever time interval you desire. The
  default is still every 7.5s.

### Fixed

- Broadway metrics prefix.
- Broadway dashboard panel descriptions and titles.
- Fixed the `:default_selected_interval` option in all dashboards.

### Changed

- Application plugin no longer logs warnings for missing GIT env vars.
- LifecycleAnnotator no longer logs warnings for missing GIT env vars.
- All plugin distribution buckets have been redefined. The reason for this being that prior to PromEx 1.7, some of the
  distribution buckets were a bit wasteful and were not adding value in terms of metrics data points. With this change,
  users should notice a decline in data point cardinality without compromising resolution.
- Application plugin has changed how it fetches dependency information. It is now using `Applciation.spec/1` to get the
  list of applications that are started with your application. This should reduce noise in the Grafana dashboard as all
  the default OTP and Elixir applications will not show up.
- All Grafana dashboard now have a default panel sort order where the largest timeseries plot is first in the list when
  hovering over the visuals.
- All Grafana dashboards now filter the instance filter based on the selected job filter.
- The Oban plugin no longer collects metrics related to `:circuit` events as those have been removed from Oban starting
  with version 2.11 (https://github.com/sorentwo/oban/pull/606). The Oban dashboard will be updated in the next release
  to remove the unused panels.
